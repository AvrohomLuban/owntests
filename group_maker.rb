# Final Review
# Create a program that puts your class into groups! Have the program request the user to enter each studentâ€™s names.  Assume the classroom has an even number of students, so there are only groups of two. For example, you can have the program output groups like so:
#   Group: Hermione Seamus
#       Group: Lucius Cho
#       Group: Sirius Luna
#       Group: Severus Draco
# Refactor the program to take an odd or even number of students. If odd, one group should have three students. 
#   Group: Hermione Seamus
#       Group: Lucius Cho
#       Group: Sirius Luna
#       Group: Severus Draco Harry
